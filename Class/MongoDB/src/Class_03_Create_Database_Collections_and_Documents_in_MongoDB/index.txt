=> to use the database:
    -> write:
        -> mongo
    -> use <database name>
        -> so, if the name is not present the it will create the new one
        -> and if the database of the same name is present then we can use it as active database
            -> ex: use romanojha
                -> output: switched to db romanojha 
        -> but after that also if the database is new then it will not show the data.
        -> because, there is a minimum requirement to show database
        -> and that is there must be atleast one collection or record(document) inside the database only after that it will show 
        -> to insert the document or the collection we have to do this:
            -> db.romandata.insertOne({name:"ReactJS",type:"FrontEnd",videos:80,active:true})
            -> {
                    "acknowledged" : true,
                    "insertedId" : ObjectId("60d42eea1db737c2658cd5ea")
                }
            -> here we can see that if we don't put id in the document then it will automatically put it 
            -> which refer the document that we just put
            -> insertedId is use as a primary key
            -> now if we will write :
                -> show dbs
                    admin      0.000GB
                    config     0.000GB
                    local      0.000GB
                    romanojha  0.000GB
            -> if you want to see the active database the you have to wirte:
                -> db
                    romanojha
            -> if you want to see collection in the database then you have to write:
                -> show collections
                    romandata
            -> if you want to see document in the data then you have to write:
                -> db.romandata.find()
                -> { "_id" : ObjectId("60d42eea1db737c2658cd5ea"), "name" : "ReactJS", "type" : "FrontEnd", "videos" : 80, "active" : true }
                ->  db.romandata.find().pretty() -> to make pretty
                ->  {
                            "_id" : ObjectId("60d42eea1db737c2658cd5ea"),
                            "name" : "ReactJS",
                            "type" : "FrontEnd",
                            "videos" : 80,
                            "active" : true
                    }
            -> to clear screen:
                -> cls
